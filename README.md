# Repository for Journal of Geophysical Research Machine Learning and Computation Submission: Ground Deformation Forecasting

## About
This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks associated with our manuscript submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Machine Learning and Computation. The paper, titled "Characterizing Seasonality and Trend from In-Situ Time-Series Observations Using Explainable Deep Learning for Ground Deformation Forecasting," explores the use of explainable deep neural network to forecast ground deformation.

## Contents
- **Notebooks**: Each notebook corresponds to specific experiments and analyses discussed in the paper. They include detailed code, visualizations, and step-by-step explanations that demonstrate the methods used for data processing, model training, feature extraction, and result interpretation.
- **Figures**: Visual outputs from the notebooks that are included in the paper. These figures illustrate key insights and results from our analysis.
